Hi my name is Eoin Mc Allister. 

I am a ML / Software Engineer with a MSc in Computer Science (AI). I graduated with a First Class Honours from NUIG Ireland in 2021. My main area of interest was Deep Reinforcement Learning in which I wrote a highly graded thesis on.

Ive created Mac Projects as a place to show off my skills and research in a tutorial like style. This project has only started in August of 2022 so contect may be sparse as everything has been made private until it is in a more presentatble / tutorial like manner.
