Hi my name is Eoin Mc Allister. 

I design Deep Learning models mainly around the topics of Reinforcement Learning and Transformers. I will be uploading my projects here and creating blogs about some of them to explain the concepts to eager learners. 
My GitHub account is currenlty under a code cleanup process as many of the repos need to be cleaned up.

There some R Data Visualisation projects taken off the Repo. To prove experience in R these are available upon request
