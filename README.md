Hi my name is Eoin Mc Allister and welcome to my GitHub. 

(Lots of content set to Private)

I am a ML / Software Engineer with a MSc in Computer Science (AI). I graduated with a First Class Honours from NUIG Ireland in 2021. My main area of interest was Deep Reinforcement Learning in which I wrote a highly graded thesis on.

I now focus Deep Learning and some Finance projects

Ive created Mac Projects as a place to show off my skills and research. This version of my GitHub started in Autumn of 2022 so lots of content is on the way!
