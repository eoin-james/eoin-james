Hi my name is Eoin Mc Allister. 

I am currently pursuing my Masters degree in Computer Science (Artificial Intellignce) in NUI Galway Ireland and hope to graduate in August 2021. I completed my Bachelors Degree in Computer and Communication Engineering in 2020 In Dublin Institute of Technology.

I am currently working on a project which aims to improve exploration in deep reinforcement learning using evolutionary algorithms to gather experience similarly to that in distributed rl algorithms. The evolutionary algorithms scoring mechanism takes ideas from novelty search and DeepMinds Never Give Up model to generate a diverse set of experiences which are both goal and curiosty driven.
