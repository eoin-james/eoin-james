Hi my name is Eoin Mc Allister. 

Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer with a keen interest in artficial intelligence (particularly deep reinforcment learning and natural language processing with neural networks). As of December 2021 I've decided to build a new Portfolio to showcase my skills in a variety of areas, each sectioned off by a different repo here on my GitHub. This portfolio is being designed in a manner to showcase my in-depth and diverse knowledge of different algorithms, toolkits etc.

A Medium blog is also in the roadmap and will be used for new eager learners, people interested in my research and to reinforce to recruiters my technical knowledge.
